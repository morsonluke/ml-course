    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- SVM are most commonly used in classification problems and they have been used in industry to make reliable predictions such as to recongnize hand-written characters which has application in things like signature recognition.[https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/]\n",
    "- Pros: it performs well in high dimensional spaces and is not too affected by outliers. \n",
    "- Cons: The model doesn't perform well when we have a large dataset as the training time required can be time consuming. It is less effective on noisier datasets with overlapping classes. It also doesn't provide probability estimates which need to be calculated using cross-validation which can be intensive. [https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/],[https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/07/support-vector-machines-simple-explanation.html]\n",
    "- This model is a good candidate as we have high dimensionality which SVM performs well on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GaussianNB\n",
    "- This model can be applied to text classification problems such as a spam email filter. It can use the \"bag of words\" feature to identify spam e-mail and gives low false positive spam detection rate which is suitable for the application of spam detection. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering\n",
    "- Pros: Computationally fast, simple to implement and works well with high dimensions being able to handle a large number of features. It also works well in the presence of irrelevant features.\n",
    "- Cons: As the model assumes independence between features (\"naive\") then there is a risk of over inflating importance of a correlated features and so can work poorly with a high number of correlated features. https://blog.sicara.com/naive-bayes-classifier-sklearn-python-example-tips-42d100429e44\n",
    "- This model could be a good approach as a we have a dataset with high dimensionality.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "- Gradient boosting has been used in as a ranking algorithm. Websites like Yahoo have used Gradient Boosting to rank web pages to suggest to users. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Usage]\n",
    "- Pros: Reduces bias and variance\n",
    "- Cons: There is a risk of overfitting on the training data and therefore the hyperparameters need to be tuned to avoid this. In comparison to the bagging ensemble method which can be done without much tuning, boosting requires much more care in its application. (Reference Practical Statistics for Data Scientist, Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce). It can also be computationally intensive when the number of trees is high. \n",
    "- This is a good candidate as Gradient Boosting classifiers are high performing and known to be low bias and high variance models which is aim for this model. The dataset is small enough to prevent requiring to much computational time. "

    "- **Metrics**: The initial model evaluation suggests the most appropriate model is the Ensemble method **Gradient Boosting**. The model has a higher accuracy on both the training and testing sets than GuassianNB and SVC models. It vastly outperforms the GaussianNB model and slightly outperforms the SCV model. Gradient Boosting also outperforms GaussianNB and SVC in terms of the F-score. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predicting & training time**: The SVC model takes significant longer to train and predict than the other models which further reduces its suitability. This is also for an unoptimized model; it's likely that any hyperparameters optimization would vastly increase the training time required. The Gradient Boosting classifier take longer than the GaussianNB model to train but this is within an acceptable amount of time and it is quick to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Suitability** - The algorithm gives a good accuracy and F-scores and seems like a suitable algorithm for the dataset. It doesn't require too long to run and with further optimization is likely to perform event better. A large amount of literature has extolled the low bias and high variance nature of Gradient boosted algorithm and mentioned it as a frequently used algorithm. It seems to be also be suitable for this dataset. "

    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is an example of an ensemble technique that uses the concept of \"boosting\". Multiple simple models, also known as weak learners, are combined together into a single model that is \"boosted\" by the combination of the simple models. This is where the ensemble term comes from - an ensemble is a combination of simple individual models that together create a more powerful new model. Gradient boosting uses sequential classifiers where each predictor learns from the previous predictor. With each sequence of models more \"weight\" is given to records with large errors. This is compared to bagging style ensemble techniques in which independent predictors are made and combined using some model averaging techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient boosting algorithm works by trying to minimise some form of loss or cost function. The word \"gradient\" comes from the facts that gradient descent is used to minimise the loss function. The overall process follows the simplified summary for a generic boosting algorithm:\n",
    "- Fit the model with simple models and analyse the data for errors. Boosting is most commonly used with decision trees. \n",
    "- The errors are then further modelled by using sequential classifiers. There is more \"weight\" given to the observations that were misclassified and so this makes the model train more heavily on the data which it performed poorly in subsequent steps. \n",
    "- The last step is to combine all the predictors by giving some weights to each predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas Adaboost (another boosting ensemble method) does this by minimised the weights, the Gradient Boosting algorithm attempts to minimise some for of cost function. \n",

    "I was correct in having age as a important feature and also education-num however I did not select the other three. In researching capital-gain it does make sense that this would be a factor. My current understanding is that this is liked to the asset value of the individual and therefore a good indicator of wealth and therefore likelihood of donating. This shows me the important of understanding your dataset fully and what each feature represents. \n",

    "The hours per week wasn't immediately obvious to me. It does make sense that overall salary would be linked to hours worked per week. Marital status is also less obvious and suggests there is a link between marital status and potential earnings.

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

Even with further hyperparameter optimization and tuning of the model, I don't thing training time would be a constraint.
